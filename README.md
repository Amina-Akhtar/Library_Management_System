# Library-Management-System
The Library Management System caters to two actors - students and librarians. This system enable students to read books online, borrow and return books. Librarians have administrative access to add and remove books efficiently. Additionally, the system provides a feature through which students can recommend currently unavailable books to be added in the library.
